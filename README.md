# pHCalculator
## Python Code for chemical solution pH calculator
This program automates pH calculations for either buffered or normal solutions and is run from the VSCode console where it requires user input
* For normal solutions, it takes user input and automates default pH calculations using the formula pH = -log[H+]
* For buffered solutions, it takes user input and automates the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation of pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
