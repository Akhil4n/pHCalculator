# pHCalculator
## Python Code for chemical solution pH calculator
This program automates pH calculations for either buffered or normal solutions and can be run from the VSCode or any other Python console where user input can be taken
* For normal solutions, it takes user input and automates default pH calculations using the formula pH = -log[H+]
* For buffered solutions, it takes user input and automates the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation of pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])
